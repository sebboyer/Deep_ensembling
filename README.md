# Deep Ensembling

Work in progress !

Deep_ensembing is a package that let you train models on different data-sets and combine their prediction to build a robust predictive model. This package is intended to prediction problems meeting the following criteria :
- Several full data sources (both features and outcomes available) available
- A binary classification problem

This package let you define easily what kind of classification model to build and how to combine them. The outcome of the workflow is a robust predictive model that is likely to perform very well on a new data source.
